# Inventory-App
Inventory Application for Android

This is a README for the Inventory App

The Inventory App is an application that allows users to keep track of, and organize their own business stock and/or inventory or personal items. The features that were required of this app were a username/password login system, a grid layout that will display the user’s items and a database that would hold said items, and finally a SMS messaging notification system that will allow users to give permission to get access to notifications that will let them know if their stock reaches zero.

This application tackles each of these functions and provides the user with an easy to understand user interface and simple controls that will allow them to use the app quickly and efficiently. Additional functions were added to the app such as a delete all button that allows the user to quickly erase all items in the inventory instead of one at a time. Other additional functions include a information and creator button and user’s permission screen that will give them some information on about why giving the app permission could give them some benefits.

Six total screens were created in order to meet the users needs. Two screens were created for the login system. One for entering the user's username and password and one more screen that allows the user to create an account. The main inventory screen is made up of a recycler view that displays the user's inventory in a grid. When the user selects "add" a new screen is opened that allows them to enter their inventory item information. Once this is done, the app will return to the inventory screen. The user can then select the item on this screen. This will open the "update" screen which allows the user to edit the inventory item's information.

When creating this app, the process that was most important was iteration. This application went through several different iterations with design and functionality. The very first design draft and prototype look much different to what is uploaded to this GitHub repository. Trial and error with the application's UI and functionality drove this iteration and helped guide it to the final product.

In order to make sure that this program work's I tested the applications numerous times. Trying to break the app was my main goal. Luckly, after iteration and iteration, the application finally worked!

Creating this app was very much a challenge since this was my first Android app. Overcoming challenges was extremely difficult, but with enough trial and error, research and iteration, I was able to overcome nearly every challenge that came my way. StackOverflow, tutorials and YouTube were great resources when I ran into these challenges.

The component that I am most excited about is the main inventory display screen. This tested my skills the most. While this may be simple to implement for a veteran programmer, I had a lot of difficulties in the beginning understanding the database that holds the user's data as well as being able to update that information. Once I finally implemented these two features, I was very excited!

For those who try out my application, please enjoy! It's not perfect, but I am still proud!
